Welcome to the Virtual Pet Shelter!
A Triple-A Game by Barbara, Alex, Charles, and Luke

**Pulitzer-Winning User Instructions**

The user will be prompted to populate the pet shelter beginning with a single pet. The user will give it a three-letter name and then be asked if he or she wants to add another. The user can add as many pets as they want.

A pet has the name that the user gives them as well as the three attributes: Hunger, boredom and sickness. The pet shelter is a collection of pets that the main app accesses to add and remove pets.

Then, the user is given a menu of activities that they can perform with the pets either individually or all at once:

• Show all pets in the shelter.
• Feed all pets.
• Play with single pet.
• Give meds to single pet.
• Take single pet out of shelter.
• Quit

Every time the user performs an action, the app performs the tick method. There is one exception: Displaying pet information will not trigger the tick method. The tick method increases all pets' hunger, sickness and boredom values by one point.
